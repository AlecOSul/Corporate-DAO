Creating a full-fledged corporate voting DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) smart contract on Ethereum is a complex and comprehensive task. Such a contract would require various components, including user authentication, token management, voting mechanisms, and more. Below, I'll provide you with a simplified example of a corporate voting DAO smart contract to get you started. Please note that this is a minimal example, and in a real-world application, you would need to consider security, gas costs, and many other factors.

This example uses the Solidity programming language. Before deploying any smart contract on the Ethereum network, it's essential to understand the associated risks and security considerations. In this smart contract:

The CorporateVotingDAO contract allows the creation of decisions and voting on those decisions. It also keeps track of user token balances.
The admin can create decisions, close decisions, and manage the DAO.
Users can vote on open decisions by specifying the decision ID, the number of tokens to vote, and whether they are voting for or against.
The contract uses an ERC-20 token for voting, and the IERC20 interface is provided for this purpose.
Remember that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need to enhance security, implement more advanced features, and consider gas costs and scalability. Additionally, you should thoroughly test and audit your smart contract before deploying it to the Ethereum network. 

A body corporate structure typically involves various aspects such as members, voting, governance, financial management, and record-keeping. Below, I'll expand the corporate voting DAO smart contract to include features suitable for a body corporate structure: In this enhanced smart contract:

votingPower mapping: Members can be assigned voting power, reflecting their stake or membership level in the body corporate.

assignVotingPower function: The admin can assign voting power to members.

hasVoted mapping: This mapping keeps track of whether a member has voted for a particular decision to prevent multiple votes.

These additions allow for more advanced functionality typical of a body corporate structure where members may have different levels of influence and where tracking member participation is important.

Please note that this is still a simplified example, and in a real-world body corporate DAO, you might need more advanced features, including financial management, member registration, and auditing. Additionally, you should consult with legal experts to ensure that your smart contract complies with relevant regulations and governance requirements.
